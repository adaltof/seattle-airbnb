* jupyter
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project was created as part of the assignments of Udacity's Data Sience Nanodegree. It aims to review data from Airbnb in Seattle and analyze some aspects related to how listings owned by professional hosts (owners with multiple listings in AirBnb) differ from the listings from people that have fewer houses on the platform. 

We provide the notebooks for the analysis in this repository, and links to the original data are posted on the notebook to allow their download directly from the source, in order to run the notebook.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The analysis process and results obtained are describde in the *Seattle-AirBnb-Project* notebook available here. It showcases the whole process used during the analysis, from data preparation to analysis results. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>
